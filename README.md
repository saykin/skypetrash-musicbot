# skypetrash-musicbot, a Discord bot.
Personal musicbot for our personal discord server, used JDA and Lava Player to make the bot.
Check Lava Player for supported links and formats.

This bot supports:
1. !play \<link\>/search string
2. !skip (next song)
3. !stop (purges queue and stops the music)
4. YouTube playlist support.
5. YouTube keyword search for top three results

You're free to use the source code, but you have to create your own bot on Discord and get your own YouTube API Token.

If you use the source code and push it to GitHub or services like it, make sure you don't add the Discord Bot Token and YouTube API Token directly to the code that is pushed.
Discord will disable the token and YouTube token might get abused.
